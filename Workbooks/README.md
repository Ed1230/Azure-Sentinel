# Azure-Sentinel Workbooks

This assumes you already have a workbook that you want to share as an Azure Sentinel template.<br/>
Once this process is completed, Sentinel users will be able to save an instance of your template that will visualize the data in their own workspace. 

To learn how to create workbooks - go to [workbooks documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-monitor-your-data).
